    "# **What is Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building models and algorithms that enable computers to learn from data **without being explicitly programmed** for every task.\n",
    "In simple terms, ML allows systems to **think, understand, and improve** by analyzing data—similar to how humans learn from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **Types of Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is commonly divided into **three core types**, with two additional modern approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning trains models using **labeled data**—where both input and output are known.\n",
    "The goal is to **predict or classify** new, unseen data accurately.\n",

    "**Common tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering** (grouping similar data points)\n",
    "* **Dimensionality reduction** (simplifying datasets while preserving meaning)\n",
