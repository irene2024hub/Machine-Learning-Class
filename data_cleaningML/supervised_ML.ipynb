    "\n",
    "Classification is a supervised learning technique used to **predict labels or categories** based on input data.\n",
    "The model assigns each data point to a predefined class (e.g., spam vs. non-spam, diseased vs. healthy).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a model trained on labeled dog vs. cat images can classify **new** images as either dogs or cats using features like **color**, **texture**, or **shape**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Binary Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest type—data is classified into **two categories**.\n",
    "Example: Email → Spam or Not Spam\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses features like keywords or sender information to decide between the two options.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Multiclass Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model classifies data into **more than two categories**.\n",

    "## **3. Multi-Label Classification**\n",

    "In multi-label classification, each input can belong to **multiple categories** at once.\n",
    "Example: A movie tagged as **Action** *and* **Comedy**.\n",

    "### **1. Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather labeled examples where each input has a corresponding class.\n",

    "### **2. Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify important attributes such as color, texture, or shape that distinguish between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm learns how features map to correct labels by identifying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the trained model on unseen data to check accuracy and generalization.\n",

    "### **5. Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicts the class of new data based on learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Iterative Improvement**\n",
